  Take my life, and let it be
  Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
  Take my moments and my days,
  Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

  Take my voice, and let me sing
  Always, only, for my King;
  Take my lips, and let them be
  Filled with messages from Thee.

  Take my intellect, and use
  Every power as Thou shalt choose.
  Take my will, and make it Thine;
  It shall be no longer mine:

  Take my love: my Lord, I pour
  At Thy feet its treasure-store;
  Take myself, and I will be
  Ever, only, all for Thee.
