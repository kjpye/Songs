In South Australia I was born
heave away! Haul away!
In South Australia 'round Cape Horn,
We're bound for South Australia.
heave away, you rolling kings,
heave away, haul away,
Heave away, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia.

When I sailed across the sea
heave away! Haul away!
My girl said she'd be true to me
We're bound for South Australia.
heave away, you rolling kings,
heave away, haul away,
Heave away, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia.

When we lolloped 'round Cape Horn
heave away! Haul away!
You'd wish to God you'd never been born
We're bound for South Aus tralia.
heave away, you rolling kings,
heave away, haul away,
Heave away, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia.

Wish I was on Australia's Strand
heave away! Haul away!
With a glass of whisky in my hand
We're bound for South Australia.
heave away, you rolling kings,
heave away, haul away,
Heave away, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia.

In South Australia I was born
heave away! Haul away!
In South Australia 'round Cape Horn,
We're bound for South Australia.
heave away, you rolling kings,
heave away, haul away,
Heave away, you'll hear me sing
We're bound for South Australia.
