  Long time a- go in Beth- le- hem, so the Ho- ly Bi- ble say
  Ma- ry's boy child, Je- sus Christ, was born on Christ- mas Day.

  Hark now hear, the an- gels sing, a king was born to- day,
  And we will live for ev- er- more, be- cause of Christ- mas Day.
  Ma- ry's boy child Je- sus Christ, was born, on Christ- mas Day.

  While Shep- herds watched their flocks by night, they see a bright new shin- ing star.
  They hear a cho- ir sing a song, the mu- sic seemed to come from a- far.
  _ _ _ _ Hark now hear, the an- gels sing, a king was born to- day.
  And we will live for ev- er- more, be- cause of Christ- mas Day.

  Oh, a mom- ent the world was a- glow, all the bells rang out there were tears of joy and laugh- ter.
  Peo- ple shout- ed let ev- ery- one know, there is hope for all to find peace.
  And then they found, a lit- tle nook, in a sta- ble all for- lorn.
  And in a man- ger cold and dark, Ma- ry's lit- tle boy was born.
