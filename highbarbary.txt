Look ahead, look astern, Look the weather in the lee.
Blow high, Blow low, And so sailed we
I see a wreck to windward and a lofty ship to lee
A sailing down along the coasts of High Barbary.

O are you a pirate or a manowar cried we.
Blow high, Blow low, And so sailed we
O no! I'm not a pirate but a manowar, cried he.
A sailing down along the coasts of High Barbary.

We'll back up our topsails and heave our vessel to;
Blow high, Blow low, And so sailed we
For we have got some letters to be carried home by you,
A sailing down along the coasts of High Barbary.

For broadside to broadside they fought all on the main
Blow high, Blow low, And so sailed we
Until at last the frigate shot the pirate's mast away
A sailing down along the coasts of High Barbary.

For quarters! For quarters! the saucy pirates cried,
Blow high, Blow low, And so sailed we
The quarters that we showed them was to sink them in the tide.
A sailing down along the coasts of High Barbary.

With cutlass and gun, O we fought for hours three.
Blow high, Blow low, And so sailed we
The ship it was our coffin and our grave it was the sea.
A sailing down along the coasts of High Barbary.
