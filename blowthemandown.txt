  Oh, blow the man down, bullies, blow the man down.
  Way hey, blow the man down.
  Oh, blow the man down, bullies, blow him away.
  Oh, gimme some time to blow the man down.

  As I was walking down Winchester Street,
  Way hey, blow the man down.
  A saucy young damsel I happened to meet,
  Oh, gimme some time to blow the man down.

  I said to her, "Polly, and how do you do"
  Way hey, blow the man down.
  Says she, "None the better for seeing of you,"
  Oh, gimme some time to blow the man down.

  Oh we'll blow the man up and we'll blow the man down,
  Way hey, blow the man down.
  We'll blow him away into Liverpool Town.
  Oh, gimme some time to blow the man down.
